# Next.js 15 Server Component Async/Await Loop Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential performance issue in Next.js 15 server components when using `async/await` within loops that iterate over large datasets. The problem arises from the asynchronous nature of the operations and the way Next.js handles promises.

## Problem Description

When performing many asynchronous operations within a loop in a server component, each `await` creates a new microtask.  If not managed carefully, this can overload the event loop and lead to slow responses or crashes.  This is particularly noticeable when dealing with large datasets where the loop executes many iterations.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques like `Promise.all` to execute asynchronous operations concurrently while still maintaining control and error handling.
