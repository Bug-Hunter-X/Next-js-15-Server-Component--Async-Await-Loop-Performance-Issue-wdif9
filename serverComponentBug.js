In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon error arises when using server components with `async/await` within a loop. If the loop iterates over a large dataset and each iteration involves an asynchronous operation (like a database fetch), it can lead to performance degradation or even crashes due to unhandled promise rejections.  The issue stems from the fact that each `await` in the loop creates a separate microtask, and if these tasks aren't properly handled, they can overwhelm the event loop.
