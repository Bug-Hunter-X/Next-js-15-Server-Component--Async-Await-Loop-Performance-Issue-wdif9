The improved solution uses `Promise.all` to handle the asynchronous operations concurrently:

```javascript
// serverComponentBugSolution.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request) {
  const largeDataset = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i);

  const results = await Promise.all(
    largeDataset.map(async (item) => {
      try {
        // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10)); 
        return item * 2; // Perform some operation
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error processing item ${item}:`, error);
        return null; // Handle errors appropriately
      }
    })
  );

  return NextResponse.json({ results });
}
```
This solution is much more efficient because it allows multiple asynchronous operations to run concurrently, significantly reducing the overall execution time for large datasets.  Proper error handling is also incorporated to prevent crashes.
